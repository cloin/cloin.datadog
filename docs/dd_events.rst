Notes
-----

.. note::
   - The script will run indefinitely until manually stopped. To stop the script, use Control-C or any other method of sending an interrupt signal to the process
   - The script uses the aiohttp and asyncio libraries for making HTTP requests and handling asynchronous tasks, respectively. Make sure these libraries are installed in your Python environment before running the script
   - This script is designed for Python 3.7 and above due to the usage of the asyncio library. Please ensure you are using an appropriate version of Python
